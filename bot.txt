HYPERTENSION

WHAT IS HYPERTENSION
Hypertension (high blood pressure) is when the pressure in your blood vessels is too high (140/90 mmHg or higher), It is common but can be serious if not treated,
People with high blood pressure may not feel symptoms, The only way to know is to get your blood pressure checked,
Things that increase the risk of having high blood pressure include:
•	older age 
•	genetics
•	being overweight or obese
•	not being physically active 
•	high-salt diet
•	drinking too much alcohol
Lifestyle changes like eating a healthier diet, quitting tobacco and being more active can help lower blood pressure, Some people may still need to take medicines,
Blood pressure is written as two numbers, The first (systolic) number represents the pressure in blood vessels when the heart contracts or beats, The second (diastolic) number represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart rests between beats,

Hypertension is diagnosed if, when it is measured on two different days, the systolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥140 mmHg and/or the diastolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥90 mmHg,
Risk factors
Modifiable risk factors include unhealthy diets (excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese,

Non-modifiable risk factors include a family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease.

SYMPTOMS OF HYPERTENSION

Most people with hypertension do not feel any symptoms, Very high blood pressures can cause headaches, blurred vision, chest pain and other symptoms, 
Checking your blood pressure is the best way to know if you have high blood pressure, If hypertension isn’t treated, it can cause other health conditions like kidney disease, heart disease and stroke,
People with very high blood pressure (usually 180/120 or higher) can experience symptoms including:
•	severe headaches
•	chest pain
•	dizziness
•	difficulty breathing
•	nausea
•	vomiting
•	blurred vision or other vision changes
•	anxiety
•	confusion
•	buzzing in the ears
•	nosebleeds
•	abnormal heart rhythm
If you are experiencing any of these symptoms and a high blood pressure, seek care immediately,
The only way to detect hypertension is to have a health professional measure blood pressure, Having blood pressure measured is quick and painless, Although individuals can measure their own blood pressure using automated devices, an evaluation by a health professional is important for assessment of risk and associated conditions.

 TREATMENTS FOR HYPERTENSION

Lifestyle changes can help lower high blood pressure, These include:
•	eating a healthy, low-salt diet
•	losing weight
•	being physically active
•	quitting tobacco
If you have high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend one or more medicines, Your recommended blood pressure goal may depend on what other health conditions you have, 
Blood pressure goal is less than 130/80 if you have:
•	cardiovascular disease (heart disease or stroke)
•	diabetes (high blood sugar)
•	chronic kidney disease
•	high risk for cardiovascular disease
For most people, the goal is to have a blood pressure less than 140/90 
There are several common blood pressure medicines: 
•	ACE inhibitors including enalapril and lisinopril relax blood vessels and prevent kidney damage,
•	Angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) including losartan and telmisartan relax blood vessels and prevent kidney damage
•	Calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and felodipine relax blood vessels
•	Diuretics including hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone eliminate extra water from the body, lowering blood pressure.

PREVENTIONS OF HYPERTENSION

Lifestyle changes can help lower high blood pressure and can help anyone with hypertension, Many who make these changes will still need to take medicine 
These lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure 
Do:
•	Eat more vegetables and fruits
•	Sit less
•	Be more physically active, which can include walking, running, swimming, dancing or activities that build strength, like lifting weights

o	Get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity
o	Do strength building exercises 2 or more days each week
•	Lose weight if you’re overweight or obese
•	Take medicines as prescribed by your health care professional
•	Keep appointments with your health care professional
Don’t:
•	eat too much salty food (try to stay under 2 grams per day)
•	eat foods high in saturated or trans fats
•	smoke or use tobacco
•	drink too much alcohol (1 drink daily max for women, 2 for men)
•	miss or share medication
Reducing hypertension prevents heart attack, stroke and kidney damage, as well as other health problems
Reduce the risks of hypertension by:
•	reducing and managing stress
•	regularly checking blood pressure
•	treating high blood pressure
•	managing other medical conditions.

COMPLICATIONS OF UNCONTROLLED HYPERTENSION

Among other complications, hypertension can cause serious damage to the heart, Excessive pressure can harden arteries, decreasing the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart, This elevated pressure and reduced blood flow can cause:
•	chest pain, also called angina;
•	heart attack, which occurs when the blood supply to the heart is blocked and heart muscle cells die from lack of oxygen, The longer the blood flow is blocked, the greater the damage to the heart;
•	heart failure, which occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to other vital body organs; and
•	irregular heart beat which can lead to a sudden death
Hypertension can also burst or block arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain, causing a stroke
In addition, hypertension can cause kidney damage, leading to kidney failure.



COVID-19(CORONA VIRUS)

OVERVIEW

COVID-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, It usually spreads between people in close contact,

COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness and death, Although a person can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, they are more likely to have mild or no symptoms

Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die, but most people will recover without treatment

People over age 60 and those with existing medical conditions have a higher risk of getting seriously ill, These conditions include high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression including HIV, cancer and pregnancy, Unvaccinated people also have a higher risk of severe symptoms.

SYMPTOMS OF CORONA VIRUS

People may experience different symptoms from COVID-19, Symptoms usually begin 5–6 days after exposure and last 1–14 days

The most common symptoms are:

fever 
chills
sore throat
Less common symptoms are:

muscle aches and heavy arms or legs
severe fatigue or tiredness
runny or blocked nose, or sneezing
headache
sore eyes
dizziness
new and persistent cough
tight chest or chest pain
shortness of breath
hoarse voice
numbness or tingling
appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea
loss or change of sense of taste or smell
difficulty sleeping
People with the following symptoms should seek immediate medical attention:

difficulty breathing, especially at rest, or unable to speak in sentences
confusion
drowsiness or loss of consciousness
persistent pain or pressure in the chest
skin being cold or clammy, or turning pale or a bluish colour
loss of speech or movement
People who have pre-existing health problems are at higher risk when they have COVID-19; they should seek medical help early if worried about their condition, These include people taking immunosuppressive medication; those with chronic heart, lung, liver or rheumatological problems; those with HIV, diabetes, cancer. obesity or dementia

People with severe disease and those needing hospital treatment should receive treatment as soon as possible. The consequences of severe COVID-19 include death, respiratory failure, sepsis, thromboembolism (blood clots), and multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys

In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection

Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, These long-term effects are called long COVID (or post COVID-19 condition), The most common symptoms associated with long COVID include fatigue, breathlessness and cognitive dysfunction (for example, confusion, forgetfulness, or a lack of mental focus or clarity), Long COVID can affect a person’s ability to perform daily activities such as work or household chores.  

TREATMENTS FOR CORONA VIRUS

Most people will recover without needing treatment in a hospital

For those who need it, doctors will suggest treatments for COVID-19 based on the severity of the disease and the risk of it getting worse, They will consider the person’s age and if they have other health problems.



PREVENTIONS OF CORONA VIRUS

People should get vaccinated as soon as it’s their turn, They should follow local guidance on vaccination and ways to protect themselves against COVID-19

COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death

To prevent the spread of COVID-19:

avoid crowds and keep a safe distance from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick;
wear a properly fitted mask if you feel sick, have been close to people who are sick, if you are at high-risk, or in crowded or poorly ventilated areas;
clean your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water;
cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze;
dispose of used tissues right away and clean your hands; and 
if you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover
Vaccination against COVID-19 is based on priority groups such as people aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic health problems, immunosuppression (including HIV), obesity, cancer, pregnant persons, and unvaccinated people, In March 2023, WHO updated its recommendations on primary series vaccination (two doses of any vaccine) as well as the need for booster doses, These recommendations are time-limited and can change at any time depending on how the SARS-CoV-2 virus is circulating in your area or country, It is important to stay up to date with local guidelines and recommendations provided by your local health authority

Since its introduction, COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives across the world by providing protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Even though vaccines protect against severe disease and death, it is still possible to spread SARS-CoV-2 to others after being vaccinated.


DIABETES 

OVERVIEW

Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose, Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels

In 2014, 8,5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes, In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1,5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years, Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths (1)

Between 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in age-standardized mortality rates from diabetes, In lower-middle-income countries, the mortality rate due to diabetes increased 13%

By contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 22% globally between 2000 and 2019.

SYMPTOMS OF DIABETES

Symptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly, In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and may take many years to be noticed

Symptoms of diabetes include:

feeling very thirsty
needing to urinate more often than usual
blurred vision
feeling tired
losing weight unintentionally
Over time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nerves

People with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failure

Diabetes can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyes

Many people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow, This can cause foot ulcers and may lead to amputation.

TYPE OF DIABETES

TYPE 1 DIABETES

Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin, In 2017 there were 9 million people with type 1 diabetes; the majority of them live in high-income countries, Neither its cause nor the means to prevent it are known.

TYPE 2 DIABETES

Type 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy, It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated

Over time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood vessels

Type 2 diabetes is often preventable, Factors that contribute to developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight, not getting enough exercise, and genetics

Early diagnosis is important to prevent the worst effects of type 2 diabetes, The best way to detect diabetes early is to get regular check-ups and blood tests with a healthcare provider

Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be mild, They may take several years to be noticed,  Symptoms may be similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked, As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen

More than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes was formerly called non-insulin dependent, or adult onset, Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but it is now also occurring increasingly frequently in children.

GESTATIONAL DIABETES

Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes, Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy

Women with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and at delivery, These women and possibly their children are also at increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the future

Gestational diabetes is diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than through reported symptoms

Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) are intermediate conditions in the transition between normality and diabetes, People with IGT or IFG are at high risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes, although this is not inevitable.

PREVENTIONS OF DIABETES

Lifestyle changes are the best way to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes

To help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should:

reach and keep a health body weight
stay physically active with at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise each day
eat a healthy diet and avoid sugar and saturated fat
not smoke tobacco
Diagnosis and treatment
Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood glucose, People with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for survival

One of the most important ways to treat diabetes is to keep a healthy lifestyle

Some people with type 2 diabetes will need to take medicines to help manage their blood sugar levels, These can include insulin injections or other medicines, Some examples include:

metformin
sulfonylureas
sodium-glucose co-transporters type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors
Along with medicines to lower blood sugar, people with diabetes often need medications to lower their blood pressure and statins to reduce the risk of complications

Additional medical care may be needed to treat the effects of diabetes:

foot care to treat ulcers
screening and treatment for kidney disease
eye exams to screen for retinopathy (which causes blindness).
